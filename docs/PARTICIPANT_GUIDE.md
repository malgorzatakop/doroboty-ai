# Participant guide

## Start

Use the prepared baseline package and Node.js 24 with npm.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3001. If Node or registry access is blocked by your organization, ask your instructor/IT rather than bypassing the policy.

## Try a complete flow

1. Choose Anna Kowalska and browse offers.
2. Save an offer, edit the profile and submit an approved application. Source notes and the editable proposal are separate.
3. Choose Karolina Wiśniewska for BrightLabs and review its candidates.
4. Record review, invitation, conversation and the next decision.
5. Return to Anna and inspect the application history.

Karolina and Tomasz see their respective companies in the interface; this is role simulation. All data is local and synthetic. CVs are prepared text examples, not real uploads. AI proposals and scores simulate the scenario.

## Save, share and recover

Changes survive reload in this browser. Settings can export a JSON file, import a scenario or reset to fixtures. Import/reset asks before replacing state. If a save is incompatible, download the original before resetting. Storage failure is shown explicitly; export before closing the tab. Use one editing tab at a time. Other tabs keep edits in memory and offer export; they cannot overwrite the saved scenario. If another tab changed the save, export your work before reloading. Use an up-to-date browser on HTTPS (localhost also works); without Web Locks, changes remain memory-only. Export before and after each session.

A URL shares the interface, not your local changes. To transfer a scenario, share the exported file and import it in the other browser. Exports include all personas, applications and notes; never enter real personal data.

## Static build

Run npm run build. Serve dist/ through any static HTTP host. No provider account is needed for local development. Do not open index.html via file://; ES modules need HTTP. Hash links work without route rewrite configuration.

## Verification

Run ./scripts/verify or npm run check. Browser tests require provisioned Playwright Chromium; a missing test browser does not prevent npm run dev. Do not let an agent install system dependencies automatically.

## If the screen stops working

Before reloading, export your work. Settings and the recovery screen offer Pobierz diagnostykę; this contains only build identity, event codes and times from the current tab. Send that file and safe reproduction steps directly to the person who shared the prototype. Keep scenario exports and answers private. The recovery screen can export the latest in-memory scenario and download the last browser save separately; reload never resets your data automatically. Diagnostics disappear on reload.
